## Usage

```ruby
  require 'south_african_air_quality_index'
  client  = SouthAfricanAirQualityIndex::Client.new

  # To list stations and available monitors:
  client.stations

  # To get the correct list of info for reports
  station_names = ['City of Johannesburg', 'City of Ekurhuleni', 'City of Cape Town']
  client.selected_stations(station_names, build_for_response: true)

  # To get a report from one stations
  # Some defaults that are used:
  # interval: DEFAULT_INTERVAL (60)
  # report_type: REPORT_TYPE (average)
  #
  # station_name - will do a best match to the name

  # end_date - can be a Time, DateTime or string 30/01/2022 00:00
  station_name = 'City of Ekurhuleni'
  start_date = Time.now - (60 * 60)
  end_date = Time.now
  client.station_report(station_name, start_date, end_date)

  # To get a report from multiple stations at once (HTML is returned for now)
  # Some defaults that are used:
